        Thanks for taking the time to assign this coursework! To support our trainees with planning and prioritising their own learning journey, we want our coursework assignments to be more informative. 
        We don't just want to tell them what to do, we want to tell them stuff like:
        - why we are doing it
        - what it's "for" (problem-solving, debugging, etc)
        - how long they should spend on it, maximum
        - how to get help 
        - how to review it with answers 
        - how to get it reviewed from mentors and peers
